The SAP2000 program is also capable of analyzing frames plates and shell for static as well as dynamic loads. In this section, its application will be extended to the analysis of a simple truss bridge.\nSAP2000 Software\nPlease follow these steps to download, install, and activate your software.\n Download  Get SAP2000 Student Version  . Run the installation.  SAP2000 programs cannot be run directly within the Mac operating system. However, if Windows operating system is virtualized on the Mac machine (via virtualization platforms such as Parallels or VirtualBox) then SAP2000 programs can be run within such virtualized Windows operating system.\n Introductory Tutorial for SAP2000 The manual provided bellow will introduces you to SAP2000. The step-by-step instructions guide you through development of your first model. The intent is to demonstrate the fundamentals and to show how quickly and easily a model can be created using the program. Completing the tutorial will give you hands-on experience working with SAP2000, which for most people is the quickest way to become familiar with the program.\n Download SAP2000 Tutorial   First Problem Solution  The pdf tutorials were created using SAP2020 v17. In the New SAP2020 v20 there are some small changes related to how live load is applied. Please follow the animation below to see how to define the loads on SAP2020 v20.\n Design and Analysis Of a WARREN Truss Bridge Perform the structural analysis of a steel truss bridge that spans a total distance of 63 ft. The truss bridge consists of two parallel trusses and the truss configuration is given in the figure below. The lower chords of the trusses support the roadway which in turn carries the car and truck traffic. The object of this analysis is to calculate the internal forces in each member of the bridge under the effect of the weight of the bridge and roadway (the dead load) and the weight of the vehicles (the live loads) that are likely to cross the bridge. It is here in assumed that the bridge carries two lanes of vehicle traffic. Make a first estimate of the internal forces in each truss member under regular truck traffic. The analysis must be performed using the SAP2000 package. Use the simplifying assumptions given below to analyze the four-bay Warren truss bridge shown in Fig 1.\nBridge Preliminary design On SAP2000  WARREN Truss bridge step by step design instructions  Download pdf file   Watch Demo video here  Similary follow the animation below to see how to define the loads on SAP2020 v20.\n Bridge Analysis, and Assessement of Results STEP 1: Calculate the areas required for each member\nUse MS-Excel to calculate the areas required for each member to carry the force produced by different loading condition considered. Recall that the analysis of the truss bridge was performed by assuming that each member had an area equal to 20in^2. To find the area required for each member to support the loading conditions, we assumed that A36 structural steel was used with a design safety factor of 1.5. the maximum possible stress is 36,000 psi for A36 steel. Therefore the allowable stress is obtained as :\n$$\\sigma_{all} = \\frac{\\sigma_{max}}{S.F} = \\frac{36,000 psi}{1.5} = 24,000 psi$$\nif the force in a member is given as F and the area is given as A, the stress in the member is $${{{\\sigma}}} = \\frac{F}{A}$$\nif the stress is set at a value equal to the allowable stress, The minimum required area for the steel member is solve as\n$$A_{min} = \\frac{F}{{\\sigma}_{all}}$$\nAs a first step in the design process. follow the summary table below:\n   Member Number Combination Force (DSTL4) $$A_{min} = \\frac{Force}{{\\sigma}_{all}}$$ $$ A_{required} = A_{min} + margin$$     1      2      \u0026hellip;       $$DSTL4 = (All\\space Live\\space Loads) + (Dead\\space Loads)$$\nNote : the margin is an estimated number that needs to be added in order to find the final area that must be used for each member, and that is the largest area obtained for that member for the different loading conditions considered.\n STEP 2: Assign the new required areas to the bridge steel members\n Go to the Steel Sections website and select the proper cross section area (e.g. W10x68 for 20in^2) calculated in the previous section. In SAP2000 select a member that you want to change the cross section then follow step 3 in the tutorial to assign it. Check the safety of a design again and make sure your member is optimum in terms of cost and not overstressed (green Color)  The following video demonstrate how to assign a cross section and check the safety of design.\n STEP 3: Cost analysis\nAfter finding the area required for each member, use this excel file template to calculate the volume V of each member. the volume is given by :\n$$V = A.L$$\nWhere A is cross sectional area of the member and L is the length of member. After finding the volume calculate the weight of each element using the specific weigth of steel.\n Steel cost $560 per ton Concrete cost $50 per cubic yard Calculate only the material cost for the steel members and roadway (neglect connections and Labor costs)  Need help? join the slack channel to request support\n Robot Design Module Robotics and Automation Project is an engaging simulation of the industrial automated manufacturing process. Teams of two students layout and program a robotic production system as a solution to the project scenario.\nFor this project students will use The ScorBot ER-4U robot arm 3D simulation software that simulate the same Robot arm we have in our enineering Lab at LaGuardia Community Collge. The robot\u0026rsquo;s speed and repeatability make it highly suited for both stand-alone operations and integrated use in automated workcell applications such as robotic welding, machine vision, CNC machine tending and other FMS operations The robot is supported by ScorBase robotics programming and control software. The software provides dynamic simulation of the robot and workcell devices during position teaching and program execution. The robot is designed to enable observation of its working mechanical parts while ensuring a safe environment for students.\nExample Applications\n ER 4U with Machine Tending (Milling/Turning/Laser Engraver) ER 4U with SkillsUSA materials handling package (RAT – Robotic Automation Technology) ER 4U with ASRS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System) ER 4U with machine vision system from Cognex for Quality Control  Student Activities   The robot Design Module activities and ER-4U simulation sotftware tutorial will be accessible from the LearnMate platform.

Example: If you are appealing a grade from the Spring 2020 semester, your deadline would be the end of the Fall 2020 semester. However, if you have not been in attendance since the grade you are appealing was posted, you may appeal the grade during the semester of your return. Example: If you are appealing a grade from the Spring 2019 semester, take a leave, and return in Spring 2021, you may proceed with the appeal.\nMore details\nHow can I determine my academic standing? DegreeWorks, regular correspondence with your Academic Advisor, and communicating with your instructors.\nHow can I get help with tutoring for my engineering courses? The MEC Webpage offers information about tutoring:\nhttps://lagccmec.online/engineering/\nIn addition, talk with your instructors about course support and tutoring.\nWhere can I find out about internship opportunities? There are plenty ways to find out about internship opportunities. Your professors may have insight about opportunities. Ask them! Student clubs also receive a lot of updated information about internships. Consider joining the:\n Engineering Program Slack Channel. Red Hawk Engineering and Computer Science Club Slack Channel:  Where can I go for software and technical support?

	"content": "Introduction to Thermodynamics for Technicians EXPERIMENT 1: CHARLES’ LAW Introduction : Charles’ Law states that at a constant pressure, the volume of a fixed mass or quantity of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature.\n$$V = c\\times T$$\nIn the formula, V is volume, T is absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and c is a constant.\nSimulator Setup and Data Collection  Launch the simulator. Click HERE. Reset the pressure to zero using the red valve under the pressure gage Reset the temperature by pressing the “Cool” until the temperature reads 10 K then press “OFF” when done. Select Gas A or Gas B. The gas of choice will be in CAPS. Push the piston three times to increase the pressure Increase the temperature by clicking “Heat” at about 500K then click “Heat” again to stop the heating. Record in the Table 1 below, the Pressure, Temperature and Volume Press “Cool” to decrease the temperature and record four more temperature and corresponding volume in the Table 1 below.  Press “Cool” to stop the cooling and get a fixed temperature reading.\n Stop recording data when you get five data points in the table.  Table 1: Experimental Data\n   Pressure - FIXED [atm] Temperature [K] Volume [l]                      Calculations and Analysis  Calculate and record the volume in m3. Draw the graph of temperature (on y-axis) versus volume (on x-axis) Determine whether the slope of the plot of temperature versus volume is linear.  Question\nHow well does your graph of temperature versus volume support the idea that volume of a gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas?\nEXPERIMENT 2: BOYLE’S LAW  Introduction  Boyle’s Law states that the product of the volume of a gas times its pressure is a constant at a fixed temperature.\n$$P\\times V = k$$\nwhere k is a constant.\nTherefore, at a fixed temperature, the pressure will be inversely proportional to the volume. As pressure increases, volume decreases. The relationship shown below shows that a plot of pressure versus the reciprocal of the volume will be linear.\n$$P=\\frac{k}{V}$$\nwhere k is a constant.\nSimulator Setup and Data Collection  Launch the simulator. Click HERE. Reset the pressure to zero using the red valve under the pressure gage Reset the temperature by pressing the “Cool” until the temperature reads 10 K then press “OFF” when done. Select Gas A or Gas B. The gas of choice will be in CAPS. Increase the temperature by clicking “Heat” at about 400K then click “Heat” again to stop the heating. Push the piston three times to increase the pressure Record in the Table 2 below, the Temperature, Volume and Pressure Press the down arrow to decrease the volume and record four more volume and corresponding pressure in the Table 2 below.

Some courses have formal lectures, similar in length and content to lectures given in face-to-face classes.\nOnline Support we want to be sure you can find the answers you need, when you need them. If you’re unsure where to turn, submit a ticket and we\u0026rsquo;ll help with your issue.\nSubmit a Ticket  "
